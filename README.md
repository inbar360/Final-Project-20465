This is my partner and I's final project of the "Systems programming laboratory" course at the open university.

Some issues/comments we had:
	- When we print to the object file an extern label in command context, we print it's value in base 100 in the memory, and signal it's extern with ARE 01.
	- If you declare an external label, declare before any command, .data and .string lines. We couldn't figure out how to solve this issue.
	- When printing to the object file, for some reason it prints the correct values for each line but the last line which has commands, which it does not print.
